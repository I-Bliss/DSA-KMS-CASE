## üìâüìç Business Insights
- Technology is the top selling product with revenue worth in five figures. And the most valuable Customer was Emily phan with an high purchase in Technological Products

- In terms of regions with highest and least sales;
  1. 3 regions are West, Ontario, Prarie
  2. the least 3 is Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon. With The total sales of Appliances in Ontario worth seven figures.

To increase Revenue for Customers with the least Revenue 
- Target low-revenue customers: Focus on customers with low revenue, such as Jeremy Farry (85.72) and Natalie DeCherney (125.90), to increase their spending.

- Analyze customer behavior: Investigate the purchasing habits and preferences of low-revenue customers to identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell.

- Personalized marketing: Develop targeted marketing campaigns to high-potential customers, such as those with revenue between 100-200 (e.g., Natalie DeCherney, Nicole Fjeld, Katrina Edelman).

- Upselling and cross-selling: Identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell products or services to customers who have already demonstrated a willingness to spend, such as Chris McAfee (350.18) and Eric Murdock (343.33).

KMS spent more on Delivery truck with a total cost of over 51,000

Erin Creighton placed the most orders as a Corporate customer, a total of 10 orders with the year 2009 and 2012

Dennis Kane is the Small Business Owner having the Highest sales with a total sales of 75,967

Customers that Returned items initially was over 800 rows after the query was executed but using reduced it to top 10, they are; are Dorothy Badders in Home office Segment, Grant Carroll in Corporate Segment, Michelle  Lonsdale in Home Office and Carlos Soltero in Small Business Segment

Based on Order Priority and Ship Mode, KMS did not appropriately spend shipping cost but it's understandable if they use the most expensive Ship mode ; Express Air, when the order priority is Critical but why use it wholesomely when the Order Priority is Low

- Also, it was noticed that Regular Air and Express Air was the most used the most based on Order Priority. Hence, KMS was not economical with spending on Ship Mode at all.
